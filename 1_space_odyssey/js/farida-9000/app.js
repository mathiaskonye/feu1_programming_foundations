 7. Android Object REFACTOR:::::

 Level 1::::::::::::::
 Refactor (change) all the variables you have in place that initializes the android into an android object.
 - Your android needs a head, upperBody, lowerBody & [ anyThingElseYouCanDreamOf ].
 - Feel free to create any new properties that will further describe your android [ anyThingYouCanDreamOf ].
 - next update your application to use this newly refactored code

 tip: the console.log that prints the variables of the android will need to be updated

 3. METEOR SHOWER::::::
    On your way to Jupiter you encounter a massive meteor shower that could damage the ship, you need to redirect the ship to a new safe location.
    a) Using a for loop iterate through the responses array and choose the appropriate response to get out of danger.
      create an if condition in your loop to print only 1 response using a comparison operator.

 4. ALIENS SPACE CRAFT ENCROACHING::::::

 5. LUNAR LANDING:::::
    We got word of an extra terrestrial sighting on the moon... we have been tasked to land on the moon
    to investigate it, we have aboard a NASA lunar module https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module
    This module will allow to land safely on the moon with the aid of the landing radar which takes inputs.

    Ensure the correct co-ordinates and approach speed are entered into the landing radar.
    It's all automated we just have to ensure that the correct values are input ie. not undefined.

    The lunar radar accepts approach speeds in increments of hundreds only, starting at 0 and maxing out at 700.

    You cannot edit the lunarRadar object directly you have to pass your values in via an interface called variables.
