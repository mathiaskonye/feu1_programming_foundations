    Ensure the correct co-ordinates and approach speed are entered into the landing radar.
    It's all automated we just have to ensure that the correct values are input ie. not undefined.

    The lunar radar accepts approach speeds in increments of hundreds only, starting at 0 and maxing out at 700.

    You cannot edit the lunarRadar object directly you have to pass your values in via an interface called variables.
