 7. Android Object REFACTOR:::::

 Level 1::::::::::::::
 Refactor (change) all the variables you have in place that initializes the android into an android object.
 - Your android needs a head, upperBody, lowerBody & [ anyThingElseYouCanDreamOf ].
 - Feel free to create any new properties that will further describe your android [ anyThingYouCanDreamOf ].
 - next update your application to use this newly refactored code

 tip: the console.log that prints the variables of the android will need to be updated

 Level 2::::::::::::::
 Refactor the planets array to be an array of objects, each object must be its own planet.
  - next update your application to use this newly refactored code

var name = "ben-9000";
