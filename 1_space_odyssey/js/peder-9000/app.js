        TIMELINE of EVENTS
      ============================================================================================
       2001: A Space Odyssey spans from the dawn of man to its title year.
             Stone Age Earth:
             In the presence of a mysterious black obelisk, pre-humans discover the use
             of tools -- and weapons -- violently taking first steps toward intelligence.

        1999: On Earth's moon astronauts uncover another mysterious black obelisk.

        2001: Between Earth and Jupiter, the spacecraft's intelligent computer makes a mistake that
              kills most of the human crew -- then continues to kill to hide its error.

        2020: The sole survivor of the journey to Jupiter ascends to the next level of humanity.
 */

/*
  You are the sole survivor who will make the journey to Jupiter.

  But before you can leave you must build an autonomous humanoid robot to help you on your mission.

  This humanoid will be used to perform dangerous and mission critical tasks on your journey to Jupiter.
  - space walks to repair the spaceship
  - fight off alien creatures
  -

  The humanoid is your doppelg√§nger, a sentient being that will help you save man from extinction by keeping you alive.

  Using JavaScript build the software that will allow us to describe and programme the humanoid to do our bidding.
